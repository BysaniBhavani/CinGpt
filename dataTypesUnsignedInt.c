// program to print unsigned integers with input as -ve and +ve valuesg
// %u is the format specifier for unsigned
//unsigned has 0 to 65,535 range limit and 16 or 32 bits size according to the system configaration
//unsigned int can only save positive(+ve) values
//Sizeof is a common operator in C. Itâ€™s used to determine the size, in bytes, of a particular data type or variable.
