A Music Website Template is a pre-designed layout for creating a music-themed webpage. By utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, developers can craft a functional and visually appealing website with features like play/pause controls, sections for home, music, about, and contact.

Approach:

We will create the basic layout i.e. two divs (left and right) inside one div tag. In the left div, we will write some text and in the right div, we will place a play or pause image. We will also create a basic nav-bar and float to the right.
With the help of CSS, we will beautify our overall structure by giving background images, padding, margin, etc.
We will use basic JavaScript functions like onclick(), play() , pause(), and getElementById() to get the current status of music and make changes accordingly.
When the user will play the music we will show a play image or icon and when the user presses pause image or icon will be displayed. This is done using a simple if-else statement.
Example: In this example, we are using the above-explained approach.
